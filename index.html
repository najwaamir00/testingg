        <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born and raised in Ipoh, I am a 20 years-old final year student at University Teknologi Mara, Kedah, majoring in information management. For my degree, I am interested in studying information system. I am very interested in my coding class and decided to continue in information system. Coding has always been an interesting subject for me, however, I never had the experience before to thoroughly understand the function and how to code. I also interested in designing, I already know how to use adobe and wanting to learn more new stuffs.
I am open to any new subject and would like to try it first, for me to have an opinion on it. I am also interested in writing, especially creative writing such as poem and novels. I have my own blog that focuses on K-pop, however, that website has not been active due to me having to focus on my study. On my free time, I like to listen to songs. I have many playlists that have different purposes. One for studying, one for relaxing before sleeps and another for exercising, and many more. Admittedly, my playlist consists of a good amount of K-pop, with a pinch of heavy metal, pop-punk and western song.</p>

        <h1>Experiences</h1>
<p>I have experiences becoming a facilitator. I actually have a certificate of facilitator as I joined the facilitator camp during my time at UITM Kedah. I also have facilitated one program at UITM Kedah, being English camp during my second semester. This experience teaches me to lead others and teach me to better communicate with other people. Not only that, it also teaches me how to work in a group setting as most programs are collaborative. 
<br><br>My personal experiences is I have organized several small scale events regarding my interest. It is a reason for us to meet our friends and catch-up with them. I first started joining cupsleeve event during June of 2019, and it started to become a hobby to collect the merchandise and cupsleeve. This experience has taught me how to organize an event, and how to deal with suppliers and get cheaper price. Unfortunately, I never had a working experience, however, I love to try and create new things.

<h3>Kindergarten</h3>
<p>During my kindergarten years, I don’t remember where I studied at.
Mainly because the kindergarten already moved to another places, and
the place are sold to another family.</p>

<h3>Primary school</h3>
<p>I studied at Methodist Girls Primary School Ipoh. During my years 
 there, there were two session, a morning (for fourth year until sixth 
 year students) and evening class (for first- and third-year student). 
 My class stayed the same for five year and during my last year, I moved 
one class back. I remember as a student, I wasn’t a diligent student but 
 I finished the school without any problem. After UPSR, I remember joining 
 a “senamrobik” competition, unfortunately, my class won the third place. </p>

<h3>Secondary School</h3>
<p>I continue my study at Methodist Girl’s Secondary School, this school is 
just next to the primary school. One unique feature about my school is that
there is no building separating the primary to the secondary school. We even
 share the canteen and main hall. Our class are in the same building but
 different floor. In my form 3, I joined the environmental club and joined them 
 going to Tempurung Cave. Form 3 also I joined a three-day camp, and it was my
 best memories, to bad I didn’t bring my phones and there weren’t many photos of us there</p>

<h3>University Year</h3>
<p>When I first come to UiTM Kedah, it was a totally new environment. I met so many 
 amazing new people. I also create so many memories. Being in university, I joined
Balloon Charity Run. I also join so many events. Not only that, I got the opportunity
 to be a facilitator for an event with outside school students. I was supposed to do another
 event during my fourth semester, however, pandemic hits us and we couldn’t continue doing it.</p>
